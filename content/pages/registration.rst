We'd love to see you at the summit!
===================================

Early bird tickets are now available, starting from **20 CHF** for regular attendees. This money will be used for promotion,
drinks and snacks.

To confirm your registration, you will be provided with an invoice with payment instructions. Your early bird registration may
be refunded by contacting us at `info@python-summit.ch` at most one month before the summit, i.e. before the 17th of january 2017.

In case of unforeseen cancellation of the event, there will be no refunds, but the registration fees
will be donated to the Python Software Foundation `https://www.python.org/psf/`_.

As you can see from the bylaws of our non-profit association `https://github.com/SwissPy/SPSA/blob/master/bylaws.md`_, we are committed
to use any extra proceeds to either organize Python events in Switzerland, or to donate it to other non-profit Python organizations.

Safe your spot at the conference now:
