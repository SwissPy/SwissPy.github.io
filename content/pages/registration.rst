We'd love to see you at the summit!
===================================

Register your ticket now, starting from **30 CHF** for regular attendees.
This money will be used for promotion, drinks and snacks.

We are a `non-profit association <https://github.com/SwissPy/SPSA/blob/master/bylaws.md>`_: any extra proceeds
will be used to organize the next edition of the Swiss Python Summit!

For registrations occurring **after the 1st of February** the ticket can only be paid cash at the
conference. This will be subject to an extra administrative charge of 10CHF compared to the current prices.
