Arrival
=======

By Train
--------

Rapperswil is a 40 minutes train ride from Zürich main station. HSR is *very*
close to Rapperswil train station. If you follow the southern exit you end up
right on campus.

For this reason we recommend the use of public transport. It's the easiest
and possibly cheapest option.

By Car
------

Parking is available at HSR for the whole day. The rates are rather pricey
though, so be warned. You do not get any discounts or free parking by
attending the conference.

There are many other parking possibilities in the area though. You can find more
information `in this PDF </files/parking.pdf>`__. The best option is probably to
get a `P+Rail day card
<https://www.sbb.ch/bahnhof-services/auto-velo/parkieren/am-bahnhof-parkieren.marketingurl_$$$parking.html>`__
and to park next to the train station (P10 on the map). An alternative would be
next to the zoo (called "Südquartier, Lido", P7 on the map).

Accessibility
=============

The venue is fully accessible by wheelchair.

Speaker Infrastructure
======================

If you are having a talk at the summit you can expect the following hardware:

* You'll get a wireless headset for recording and amplification.
* The projectors have HDMI and VGA connectors. We should have video adapters
  for most common connectors.
* Your presentation will be shown with a resolution of 1920x1200 (16:10).

If you plan to have output audio of any kind, do let us know beforehand as we
have to integrate that into our recording.

Job Board
=========

We are going to have a wall with open jobs. If you want to advertise an open
position do print information about it on an A4 page (in portrait orientation)
and we'll hang it up on the wall.

We will also have some empty pages available for ad-hoc job postings.
