Call for Proposals

A Python Conference in Switzerland
==================================

The Swiss Python Summit 2016 was a blast! We had magnificent talks and met lots of brilliant people. That's why we decided
to have a second edition of the conference to take place on **February 17th, 2017** at
**HSR University of Applied Sciences in Rapperswil**.

This summit is all about the programming language you love!
Discover the wide field of Python applications, hear how others use the language
and meet Swiss Pythonistas. The conference is suited for all skill levels,
from early beginners to expert developers.

History
=======

After the nice experience of EuroPython 2015, a small group of enthusiasts came
up with the idea of organizing a Swiss Python Conference. After a few meetings
and discussions, we organized a small, one-day, single-track and very-low-cost
event. We expected around 50 people, but 130 signed up. It was a great success.

You can find last year's program `here </pages/program2016.html>`__. Talk
recordings and slids can be found on the `recordings
</pages/recordings.html>`__ page.
