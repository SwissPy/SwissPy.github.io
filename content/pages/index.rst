History
=======

After the nice experience of EuroPython 2015, a small group of enthusiasts came
up with the idea of organizing a Swiss Python Conference. After a few meetings
and discussions, we organized a small, one-day, single-track and very-low-cost
event. We expected around 50 people, but 130 signed up. It was a great success,
so we decided to continue organizing the conference.

You can find program from previous years online:
