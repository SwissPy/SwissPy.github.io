A Python Conference in Switzerland

This summit is all about the programming language you love!
Discover the wide field of Python applications, hear how others use the language
and meet Swiss Pythonistas. The conference is suited for all skill levels,

History
=======

After the nice experience of EuroPython 2015, a small group of enthusiasts came
up with the idea of organizing a Swiss Python Conference. After a few meetings
and discussions, we organized a small, one-day, single-track and very-low-cost
event. We expected around 50 people, but 130 signed up. It was a great success.

You can find program from previous years online:
