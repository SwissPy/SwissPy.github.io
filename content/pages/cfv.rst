The Swiss Python Summit 2018 needs a home
=============================================

Help us find an ideal venue for the conference.

While we all love the quiet and beautiful location that HSR has provided for the last editions, the committee is also aware that this is aims to be national and inclusive conference, and as such we are open to host it in a different part of the country if the appropriate conditions are given.

If you have a good idea for a cool and suitable location please let us know at info@python-summit.ch.

The call for venues closes on July 15th 2017
