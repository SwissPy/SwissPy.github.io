Join Us as a Helper on the Day of the Conference
================================================

Do you want to attend the conference and help us on that day? Then please let
us know.

We can always use more helpers to chair sessions, help at the registration desk,
take photos, videotape the talks or man our twitter account for some live tweeting.

Being a helper on the day of the conference is the best way to really engage
in the conference and to meet people without the awkard "so what do you do?".

Let us know at `info@python-summit.ch
<mailto:info@python-summit.ch?subject=I%20want%20to%20help!>`__ if you're
interested.

Organize the Next Summit With Us
================================

The Swiss Python Summit is organized by the "Swiss Python Summit Association".

This is mainly a legal construct necessary to hold a bank account and to sign
contracts without putting any single person on the hook.

If you want to become an organizer, that is you want to help us all year round
to prepare for the best day of the year, let us know at `info@python-summit.ch
<mailto:info@python-summit.ch?subject=I%20want%20to%20join%20the%20SPSA!>`__

We always have some job to do, from working with sponsors to updating the
website, designing the print materials or organising the registration
process. As a member you'll be able to influence where this conference is
headed. Figuratively and literally!

Note that members are required to pay a small membership fee of 20 CHF a year.
This fee is used to cover the running costs of the association and it is meant to
be a symbolic token that helps us avoid gathering passive members.

You can find the bylaws of the association here, if you are into this kind
of stuff: `<https://github.com/SwissPy/swisspycon/tree/master/association>`_.

Help us by Sponsoring our Event
===============================

Last year's conference drew around 110 attendees interested in programming with
Python. This year we expect this number to swell to 200 attendees. That's 200
people that will see your logo and associate your company with our conference.

From the feedback we got we can say with confidence, that this is a very good
thing. Who knows, your next newly hire might find out about you during our
conference.

We try to keep the list of our sponsors exclusive, because no-one remembers
one company out of a hundred. So if you are interested, act fast as the
spots on our sponsorship plans won't be available for long.

If you are interested, contact us at `info@python-summit.ch
<mailto:info@python-summit.ch?subject=Sponsorship%20Request>`__ if you're
interested.
