                <p class="description">Have you ever been really annoyed
                about some APIs of open source libraries? There's are good
                reasons to be. Most libraries are devoted to backwards
                compatibility and are not able to change content anymore.
                <br>
                Coming from writing a Python library called "Jedi", I can
                feel with you. I have hated my own APIs more than enough. I
                have learned the hard way and want to tell you a few things
                I would have loved to hear years earlier!
                <br>
                <strong>Designing Python APIs</strong>
                <br>
                Quite a few common pitfalls exist in API design in Python.
                To name a few: Overuse of properties, classes that should be
                functions, javaisms and a lot of other issues. Learn to see
                the difference between good & bad.
                <br>
                There's a lot to learn from our external APIs for our
                internal APIs or in general software architecture. Bad
                internal APIs lead to code smells. You will learn how to
                detect code smell that points to bad APIs.
                <br>
                <strong>Dicussing well-known libraries</strong>
                <br>
                We will analyze well known libraries like requests,
                BeautifulSoup, Django and more. I will tell you what they
                did well and where they struggle. Some libraries have with
                immense capabilities have not been used very much, because
                their APIs are too complicated. We will also be talking
                about how Amazon won the cloud storage game, the way Docker
                wins everything else and why some other awesome tools don't
                seem to get very far!

                <p class="description">I will introduce CFFI, a way to call
                C libraries from Python. It was designed in 2012 to get away
                from Python's C extension modules, which require
                hand-written CPython-specific C code. CFFI is arguably
                simpler to use: you call C from Python directly, instead of
                going through an intermediate layer. It is not tied to
                CPython's internals, and works natively on two different
                Python implementations: CPython and PyPy. (It is also a big
                success, according to the download statistics.)
                <br>
                PyPy is an alternative Python implementation, which is
                highly compatible with CPython but rewritten from
                scratch – in Python. It is much faster than the standard
                CPython on long-running tasks thanks to its Just-in-Time
                compiler. I will talk about it during the later part of the
                talk.</p>

                <p class="description">At Les Chemins de Traverse we explore
                ways of "augmenting" acoustical musical instruments with new
                possibilities offered by computers. For doing so, we need
                ultra-low latency real-time audio processing programs.
                Pretty much the typical situation where python should *not*
                be used, right?  Wrong. We've recently included python (with
                a strong use of Olivier Bélanger's wonderful pyo module) in
                our set of tools for realizing the musical ideas we have in
                mind. This talk will expose why we came to consider python
                as a very interesting option for our realtime audio systems
                and how we use it on stage, with code and sound samples.</p>

                I am involved with. These include mapping the dark matter in

                <p class="description">Scrapy is a versatile tool to scrape
                web pages with Python. Thanks to its pipeline architecture,
                it is easy to add new consumers to work on the scraped data.
                One such pipeline allows us to index the scraped data with
                Elasticsearch. With Elasticsearch, we can make the scraped
                data searchable in a highly efficient way. In this talk, we
                will not only show you the basics of the interaction between
                Scrapy and Elasticsearch, but also a hands-on showcase where
                we use these tools to collect sport results of Swiss running
